I'm a first-year graduate student from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [Georgia Institute of Technology, Shenzhen Campus](https://www/gatech.edu). My research interest includes statistical machine learning, optimization, and reinforcement learning. I majored in Math when taking my undergraduate study at Hebei University of Technology. Then I found it extremely important to improve my coding skills and decided to go to Georgia Tech to study ECE(machine learning track).
